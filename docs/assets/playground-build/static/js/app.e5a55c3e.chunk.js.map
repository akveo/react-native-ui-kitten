To do this, we call `dispatch` function when Touchable is pressed.\n * Then, when touch is released, we request nothing, which stands for `default`.\n *\n * @overview-example StyledComponentVariants\n * Now let's say we want to have a `status` property to make component change its color, for example,\n * within the forms validation. Furthermore, we want to control its color for both statuses when it is pressed.\n *\n * The `variantGroups` key in `meta` defines all properties that can be applied by component.\n * Each key in variant group is a string value that can be passed to component props.\n */\nexport const styled = (name: string): StyledComponent => {\n  return (component: WrappedComponent): StyledComponent => {\n    return styleInjector(component, name);\n  };\n};\n\nconst styleInjector = (Component: WrappedComponent, name: string): StyledComponent => {\n\n  if (!name) {\n    console.warn('Components annotated with @styled function should also have its in mapping.json.');\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  class Wrapper extends React.Component<PrivateRefProps, State> {\n\n    public state: State = {\n      interaction: [],\n    };\n\n    private init: boolean = false;\n    private defaultProps: WrappedComponentProps;\n    private service: StyleConsumerService;\n\n    private onInit = (style: ThemeStyleType, theme: ThemeType): void => {\n      this.service = new StyleConsumerService(name, style);\n      this.defaultProps = this.service.createDefaultProps();\n      this.init = true;\n    };\n\n    private onDispatch = (interaction: Interaction[]): void => {\n      this.setState({ interaction });\n    };\n\n    private withEvaProp = (sourceProps: WrappedComponentProps,\n                           sourceStyle: ThemeStyleType,\n                           theme: ThemeType): StyledComponentProps => {\n\n      const props: WrappedComponentProps = { ...this.defaultProps, ...sourceProps };\n      const style: StyleType = this.service.createStyleProp(props, sourceStyle, theme, this.state.interaction);\n\n      return {\n        ...props,\n        eva: {\n          theme,\n          style,\n          dispatch: this.onDispatch,\n        },\n      };\n    };\n\n    private renderWrappedElement = (style: ThemeStyleType, theme: ThemeType): React.ReactElement => {\n      if (!this.init) {\n        this.onInit(style, theme);\n      }\n\n      const { forwardedRef, ...restProps } = this.props;\n\n      return (\n        <Component\n          {...this.withEvaProp(restProps as any, style, theme)}\n          ref={forwardedRef}\n        />\n      );\n    };\n\n    public render(): React.ReactElement {\n      return (\n        <MappingContext.Consumer>{(style: ThemeStyleType): React.ReactElement => (\n          <ThemeContext.Consumer>{(theme: ThemeType): React.ReactElement => {\n            return this.renderWrappedElement(style, theme);\n          }}</ThemeContext.Consumer>\n        )}</MappingContext.Consumer>\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  const WrappingElement = (props: WrappedComponentProps, ref: React.Ref<React.ReactInstance>): React.ReactElement => {\n    return (\n      <Wrapper\n        {...props}\n        forwardedRef={ref}\n      />\n    );\n  };\n\n  const ResultComponent = React.forwardRef<React.ReactInstance, PrivateRefProps>(WrappingElement);\n  ResultComponent.displayName = Component.displayName || Component.name;\n  hoistNonReactStatics(ResultComponent, Component);\n\n  return ResultComponent;\n};\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Akveo.
