`disabled` property.\n *\n * @overview-example SelectDisabledOptions\n * Same for options.\n *\n * @overview-example SelectStatus\n * It also may be marked with `status` property, which is useful within forms validation.\n * An extra status is `control`, which is designed to be used on high-contrast backgrounds.\n *\n * @overview-example SelectAccessories\n * Select may contain labels, captions and inner views by configuring `accessoryLeft` or `accessoryRight` properties.\n * Within Eva, Select accessories are expected to be images or [svg icons](guides/icon-packages).\n *\n * @overview-example SelectSize\n * To resize Select, a `size` property may be used.\n *\n * @overview-example SelectStyling\n * Select and it's inner views can be styled by passing them as function
