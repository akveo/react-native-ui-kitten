# 4.x - 5.0.0 UI Kitten Migration

UI Kitten v5.0 is a significant improvement and rework of the previous version.
We believe these changes bring UI Kitten to the new level of quality and feature richness.
To achieve this and allow UI Kitten to grow faster and better, we had to refactor a lot of internal implementations,
as well as public APIs.

We hope that next UI Kitten versions won't receive such significant upgrades
and the amount of breaking changes will be kept as low as possible.

### Migration Purposes

- Flexible styling with new convenient and unified component interfaces;
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming" target="_blank">Declarative</a> way of rendering nested components;
- Better typescript support;
- Better documentation with detailed description for component examples and properties.

<hr>

## Understanding new API

To slightly simplify the migration process we strongly recommend getting familiar with
the short list of rules we followed during the refactoring process:

1. All components that previously could render a text by passing a string to a corresponding property
now may accept a string, number, or a function component. 
If the function is passed, it will be called with style properties provided by Eva.
This makes *{componentName}Style* properties redundant.

2. In order to follow the rule above, CheckBox, Radio and Toggle components now accept the text as a child element.

3. Icon properties are renamed to `accessoryLeft` and `accessoryRight`.
(Except tabs, because it may have only one icon).

4. Popover and related components (Tooltip and OverflowMenu) now accept its content as a child element.
A component relative to which the content is rendered is now passed to `anchor` property.

## Migration Steps

The following migration steps are required to update:

- Update `@ui-kitten/*` packages to version 5 *required*
- Update `@eva-design/*` packages to version 2 *required*

<hr>

## Update UI Kitten

```bash
npm i @ui-kitten/components @eva-design/eva

// Using Yarn?
yarn add @ui-kitten/components @eva-design/eva
```

Additionally, if you use any other UI Kitten packages, you can add them like this:
```bash
npm i @ui-kitten/eva-icons

// Using Yarn?
yarn add @ui-kitten/eva-icons
```

## Migrate Components

### Button

[Button](components/button) does not accept `textStyle` property anymore.
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be used as a child element.

```js
import { Button, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Button>
  {evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>BUTTON</Text>}
</Button>
```

Icons within Button now are rendered with `accessoryLeft` or `accessoryRight` properties,
replacing the old `icon` property.

```js
import { Button, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const StarIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='star' />
);

<Button accessoryRight={StarIcon} />
```

### Radio

[Radio](components/radio) does not accept `text` property anymore.
It was moved to children in favor of using a declarative way of building components.

```js
import { Radio } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Radio>Place your Text</Radio>
```

Also, `textStyle` property is no longer supported.
Instead, a function component with additional text style should be used as a child element.

```js
import { Radio, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

  {evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Text</Text>}
</Radio>
```

### CheckBox

[CheckBox](components/checkbox) does not accept `text` property anymore.
It was moved to children in favor of using a declarative way of building components.

  {evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Text</Text>}
</CheckBox>
```

### Toggle

[Toggle](components/toggle) does not accept `text` property anymore.
It was moved to children in favor of using a declarative way of building components.

Instead, the function component with additional text style should be used as a child element.

```js
import { Toggle, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Toggle>
  {evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Text</Text>}
</Toggle>
```

### Input

[Input](components/input) has no `icon` property anymore.
Instead, `accessoryRight` or `accessoryLeft` properties should be used.

```js
import { Input, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const StarIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='star' />
);

<Input accessoryRight={StarIcon} />
```

Also, `labelStyle` and `captionStyle` properties are no longer supported.
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be passed to the corresponding property.

```js
import { Input, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Input 
  label={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
  caption={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
/>
```

### Datepicker and RangeDatepicker

[Datepicker](components/datepicker) has no `icon` property anymore.
Instead, `accessoryRight` or `accessoryLeft` properties should be used.

```js
import { Datepicker, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const StarIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='star' />
);

<Datepicker accessoryRight={StarIcon} />
```

Also, `labelStyle` and `captionStyle` properties are no longer supported.

  label={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
  caption={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
/>
```

### Select

[Select](components/select) now exports two related components - `SelectItem` and `SelectGroup`,
which makes it possible to accept any type of data not requiring you to have `text` properties for its items.
Now its contents are fully controlled by you as a developer and should be passed as child elements.

```js
import { Select, SelectItem } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Select>
  <SelectItem title='Option 1' />
  <SelectGroup title='Group 2'>
    <SelectItem title='Option 1.1' />
    <SelectItem title='Option 1.2' />
  </SelectGroup>
</Select>
```

Also, `labelStyle`, `captionStyle` and `placeholderStyle` properties are no longer supported.
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be passed to the corresponding property.

```js
import { Select, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Select 
  label={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
  caption={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
  placeholder={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Placeholder</Text>}
/>
```

Icons within Select now are rendered with `accessoryLeft` or `accessoryRight` properties,
replacing the old `icon` property.

```js
import { Select, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const StarIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='star' />
);

<Select accessoryRight={StarIcon} />
```

We also strongly recommend visiting [Select Overview](components/select) page to become familiar with its API
since its selection functionality was completely reworked.

### Autocomplete

[Autocomplete](components/autocomplete) now exports a related component - `AutocompleteItem`,
which makes it possible to accept any type of data not requiring you to have `title` properties for its items.
Now its contents are fully controlled by you as a developer and should be passed as child elements.

For this reason, it removes `renderItem` and `placeholderData` properties in favor of children.

```js
import { Autocomplete, AutocompleteItem } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Autocomplete>
  <AutocompleteItem title='Option 1' />
  <AutocompleteItem title='Option 2' />
  <AutocompleteItem title='Option 3' />
</Autocomplete>
```

Also, `labelStyle` and `captionStyle` properties are no longer supported.
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be passed to corresponding property.

```js
import { Autocomplete, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Autocomplete 
  label={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
  caption={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Label</Text>}
/>
```

Icons within Autocomplete now are rendered with `accessoryLeft` or `accessoryRight` properties,
replacing the old `icon` property.

```js
import { Autocomplete, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const StarIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='star' />
);

<Autocomplete accessoryRight={StarIcon} />
```

### Bottom Navigation and Tabs

[Tabs](components/bottom-tabs/overview#bottomnavigationtab) do not accept `titleStyle` property anymore. 
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be passed to `title` property.

```js
import { BottomNavigationTab, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<BottomNavigation>
  <BottomNavigationTab title={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Tab 1</Text>}/>
  <BottomNavigationTab title={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Tab 2</Text>}/>
</BottomNavigation>
```

### TabBar and Tabs

[Tabs](components/top-tabs/overview#tab) do not accept `titleStyle` property anymore. 
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be passed to `title` property.

```js
import { TabBar, Tab, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<TabBar>
  <Tab title={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Tab 1</Text>}/>
  <Tab title={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Tab 2</Text>}/>
</TabBar>
```

### TopNavigation and Actions

[TopNavigation](components/top-navigation) title and description properties now may accept any component instead of only strings.
This made us remove `titleStyle` and `subtitleStyle` properties.
Instead, the function component with additional text style should be used as a child element.

```js
import { TopNavigation, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<TopNavigation
  title={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Title</Text>}
  subtitle={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Subtitle</Text>}
/>
```

To support consistency with other components,
Actions within TopNavigation now are rendered with `accessoryLeft` and `accessoryRight` properties,
replacing old `leftControl` and `rightControls`.

```js
import { TopNavigation, TopNavigationAction, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const BackIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='arrow-ios-back' />
);

const SettingsIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='settings' />
);

const BackAction = () => (
  <TopNavigationAction icon={BackIcon} />
);

const SettingsAction = () => (
  <TopNavigationAction icon={SettingsIcon} />
);

<TopNavigation 
  accessoryLeft={BackAction}
  accessoryRight={SettingsAction}
/>
```

Multiple actions can be rendered by combining them in `React.Fragment`.

### Drawer

[Drawer](components/drawer) now exports two related components - `DrawerItem` and `DrawerGroup`,
which makes it possible to accept any type of data not requiring you to have `title` properties for its items.
Now its contents are fully controlled by you as a developer and should be passed as child elements.

```js
import { Drawer, DrawerItem, DrawerGroup } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Drawer>
  <DrawerItem title='Option 1'/>
  <DrawerGroup title='Group'>
    <DrawerItem title='Option 1.1'/>
    <DrawerItem title='Option 1.2'/>
  </DrawerGroup>
</Drawer>
```

Also, it does not export `DrawerHeaderFooter` component anymore as we find it useless.
Instead, `header` and `footer` properties accept styles provided by Eva that should be used as the style
of the container for Header of Footer of Cards.

```js
import { Drawer, Layout, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const Header = (evaProps) => (
  <Layout {...evaProps} level='2'/>
);

const Footer = (evaProps) => (
  <Layout {...evaProps}>
    <Text category='c2'>Footer</Text>
  </Layout>
);


<Drawer header={Header} footer={Footer}/>
```

We also strongly recommend visiting [Drawer Overview](components/drawer) page to become familiar with its API
since its selection functionality was completely reworked.

### Menu

[Menu](components/menu) now exports two related components - `MenuItem` and `MenuGroup`,
which makes it possible to accept any type of data not requiring you to have `title` properties for its items.
Now its contents are fully controlled by you as a developer and should be passed as child elements.

```js
import { Menu, MenuItem, MenuGroup } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<Menu>
  <MenuItem title='Option 1'/>
  <MenuGroup title='Group'>
    <MenuItem title='Option 1.1'/>
    <MenuItem title='Option 1.2'/>
  </MenuGroup>
</Menu>
```

We also strongly recommend visiting [Menu Overview](components/menu) page to become familiar with its API
since its selection functionality was completely reworked.

### Popover

[Popover](components/popover) now accept its content as child element.
A component relative to which the content is rendered is now passed to `anchor` property.

```js
import { Popover, Layout, Text, Button } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const renderToggleButton = () => (
  <Button>TOGGLE POPOVER</Button>
);

<Popover anchor={renderToggleButton}>
  <Layout>
    <Text>Welcome to UI Kitten</Text>
  </Layout>
</Popover>
```

### Tooltip

[Tooltip](components/tooltip) now accept its text as child element.
A component relative to which the content is rendered is now passed to `anchor` property.

```js
import { Tooltip, Button } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const renderToggleButton = () => (
  <Button>TOGGLE TOOLTIP</Button>
);

<Tooltip anchor={renderToggleButton}>
  Welcome to UI Kitten
</Tooltip>
```

### Overflow Menu

[OverflowMenu](components/overflow-menu) `data` property is replaced in favor to child elements,
which makes it possible to accept any type of data not requiring you to have `title` properties for its items.
Now its contents are fully controlled by you as a developer and should be passed as child elements.

A component relative to which the menu is rendered is now passed to `anchor` property.

```js
import { OverflowMenu, MenuItem, Button } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const renderToggleButton = () => (
  <Button>TOGGLE MENU</Button>
);

<OverflowMenu anchor={renderToggleButton}>
  <MenuItem title='Option 1' />
  <MenuItem title='Option 2' />
  <MenuItem title='Option 3' />
</OverflowMenu>
```

We also strongly recommend visiting [OverflowMenu Overview](components/overflow-menu) page to become familiar with its API
since its selection functionality was completely reworked.

### List and Items

[ListItem](components/list/overview#listitem) now calls `onPress` **without** its index.
We were motivated to remove this in favor of having better performance when rendering large lists.


Also, `titleStyle` and `descriptionStyle` properties are no longer supported.
Instead, if having custom styles is required,
function component with additional text style should be passed to the corresponding property.

```js
import { ListItem, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

<ListItem 
  title={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Title</Text>}
  description={evaProps => <Text {...evaProps} style={[evaProps.style, myStyle]}>Description</Text>}
/>
```

Icons within List Items now are rendered with `accessoryLeft` or `accessoryRight` properties,
replacing old `icon` and `accessory` properties.

```js
import { ListItem, Icon } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const StarIcon = (evaProps) => (
  <Icon {...evaProps} name='star' />
);

<ListItem accessoryRight={StarIcon} />
```

### Card

[Card](components/card) does not export `CardHeader` component anymore as we find it useless.
Instead, `header` and `footer` properties accept styles provided by Eva that should be used as the style
of the container for Header of Footer of Cards.

```js
import { Card, Layout, Text } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const Header = (evaProps) => (
  <Layout {...evaProps}>
    <Text category='h6'>Title</Text>
    <Text category='s1'>Description</Text>
  </Layout>
);

const Footer = (evaProps) => (
  <Layout {...evaProps}>
    <Text category='c2'>Footer</Text>
  </Layout>
);


<Card header={Header} footer={Footer}/>
```

<hr>

## Migrate High Order Components

For components wrapped in UI Kitten High Order Functions,
we combined properties it injects into a single one for having better control on it
and reduce the number of compiler warnings when an unexpected property is passed to an unexpected component.

### withStyles

Now injects a single `eva` property, which combines `theme` and `style`.

```js
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { withStyles } from '@ui-kitten/components';

const MyComponent = (props) => (
  <View style={props.eva.style.container}/>
);

export const MyStyledComponent = withStyles(MyComponent, theme => ({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: theme['color-primary-default'],
  },
}));
```

### styled

Now injects a single `eva` property, which combines `dispatch` function, `theme` and `style` properties.
Also, it was re-implemented to be decorator.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { styled } from '@ui-kitten/components';

@styled('MyComponent')
export class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  render() {
    const { eva, ...restProps } = this.props;
    return (
      <View />
    );
  }
}
```
