# Code Autocompletion

UI Kitten provides code autocompletion functionality for code editors such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or Sublime Text. The feature provides code suggestions, syntax highlighting, and other code editing aids to help developers write code more efficiently and with fewer errors.

## Components

The code completion feature for components is working "out of the box" for predefined mapping types.

Also, it is possible to use the code completion feature with user components types added with [custom mapping](design-system/customize-mapping).
To do that, just setup UI Kitten [metro bundler config](guides/improving-performance). After starting metro server, it will parse the file and add new types to declaration.

If necessary, you can use the generated types in props definition for your custom components created using UI Kitten. The generated types file is located in `node_modules/@eva-design/eva/mapping.types.ts`

## Theme

It is also possible to use autocompletion with style definitions. In order to get it worked, it is necessary to use [declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html) typescript feature.
To do that, just create a `ts` file in your project with the merging declaration: 

```js
import {ColorValue} from 'react-native/Libraries/StyleSheet/StyleSheet';
import {ThemeColors} from '@eva-design/eva/theme.types';

declare global {
  interface ViewStyle {
    backgroundColor?: ColorValue | undefined | ThemeColors;
    borderColor?: ColorValue | undefined | ThemeColors;
  }
}
```
The declaration extends standard react-native interface with `ThemeColors` which is base theme autogenerated type (there are only `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` props are redefined in the example, but you can add additional props if needed).
If you have your own theme, it is possible to add your keys into that `ThemeColors` type either. It can be done with the [metro bundler config customization](guides/improving-performance) feature already used in the case above. The only additional step is adding path to your theme to appropriate `EvaConfig` property:

```js
const evaConfig = {
  evaPackage: '@eva-design/eva',
  customMappingPath: './myMapping.json',
  customThemePath: './myTheme.json',
};
```
After starting metro, it will regenerate `ThemeColors` type by adding your theme values.
